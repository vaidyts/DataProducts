Welcome to the course project done by yours truly as part of the Coursera "Developing Data Products" course. 

The demand for vintage cars is really booming. This would be the perfect time to set up a vintage car business. We have built a Vintage Cars Selector App using Shiny based on the ```mtcars``` dataset.

The App is easy to use. On the App's sidebar is the user input section where the user can choose different parameters such as desired mileage, nummber of gears, horse power, displacement in cc, automatic or manual transmission, etc. Based on thse inputs, the main panel displays the car(s) satisfying the user criteria. The app is available at https://vaidyts.shinyapps.io/vintagecars/

Hope you like it. Any feedback is most welcome.

Regards
Vaidy Subramanian
