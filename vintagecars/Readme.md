The demand for vintage cars is really booming. This would be the perfect time to set up a vintage car business. We have built a Vintage Cars Selector App using Shiny based on the ```mtcars``` dataset. Based on the inputs provided by the user, the App will select the car(s) satisfying the requirements. The app is available at https://vaidyts.shinyapps.io/vintagecars/

The App is easy to use. On the App's sidebar is the user input section where the user can choose different parameters such as desired mileage, nummber of gears, horse power, displacement in cc, automatic or manual transmission, etc. Based on thse inputs, the main panel displays the car(s) satisfying the user criteria
